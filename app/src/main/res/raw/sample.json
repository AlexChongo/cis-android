O blessed thought!<br/>\n The trav'ler's lonely heart to cheer;<br/>\n  With oft a heal-ing balm has brought,<br/>\n  And dried the mourner's tear.<br/>\n  Then weep no more, since we shall meet <br/>\n  Where weary footsteps never roam-<br/>\nOur tri-als past our joys complete,<br/>\nSafe in our Father's home.\n</p>\n\n\n"
